    title: "How CNN Models Power Visual Intelligence",
    description:
      "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are the core of modern visual intelligence. This article breaks down the CNN architecture, from convolution layers and pooling to fully connected layers. It also showcases how CNNs are used in real-world applications such as medical imaging, facial recognition, and object detection. We also introduce popular CNN models like ResNet, VGG, and MobileNet, and discuss their trade-offs for performance and accuracy.",

    title: "AI Meets MERN: Integrating Machine Learning in Web Apps",
    description:
      "Imagine a web app that lets users upload an image and instantly get intelligent feedback. This blog explains how to integrate machine learning models—like image classifiers or sentiment analyzers—into a MERN stack app. We walk through using Flask or FastAPI to expose a Python model as an API, then show how to consume that API in a React frontend. This fusion of AI and web tech opens doors to next-gen user experiences.",
