    title: "Building Scalable Apps with the MERN Stack",
    description: `
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The MERN stack is a popular JavaScript framework that empowers developers to create scalable, maintainable, and modern web applications from front to back using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js.</p>
      
      <h2>Best Practices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Normalize MongoDB schemas with Mongoose</li>
        <li>Use middleware in Express for clean request/response flow</li>
        <li>Leverage React Context API for scalable state management</li>
        <li>Implement JWT-based authentication and refresh tokens</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Scalability Tips</h2>
      <p>Use load balancers, containerization (like Docker), and deploy with CI/CD pipelines to ensure high performance. Apply modular coding practices and split your backend into microservices if needed.</p>

    title: "How CNN Models Power Visual Intelligence",
    description: `
      <h2>What Are CNNs?</h2>
      <p>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are designed to automatically learn visual patterns from images. They are inspired by the biological visual cortex and have become a standard for image classification and recognition tasks.</p>
      
      <h2>Architecture Components</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Convolution layers to extract features</li>
        <li>Pooling layers to reduce dimensionality</li>
        <li>Fully connected layers for classification</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Real-World Use Cases</h2>
      <p>From medical imaging diagnostics to self-checkout systems in retail, CNNs enable machines to understand the visual world. Popular architectures include ResNet (deep networks), VGG (simple yet powerful), and MobileNet (lightweight for mobile).</p>

    description: `
      <h2>Why Node.js and Express?</h2>
      <p>Node.js and Express.js form a powerful combination for building scalable backend services. Node's non-blocking I/O and Express's minimalistic structure allow developers to build APIs quickly and efficiently.</p>
      
      <h2>Architecture Essentials</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Organize routes with modular structure</li>
        <li>Use middlewares for validation, auth, and logging</li>
        <li>Secure APIs with rate limiting and CORS handling</li>
        <li>Connect to MongoDB via Mongoose with schema validation</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Deployment Tips</h2>
      <p>Use environment variables, proper logging, error handling, and security headers. Tools like PM2 and Docker help you scale and maintain your service in production environments.</p>

    description: `
      <h2>The Vision</h2>
      <p>Imagine a smart web app that understands images, analyzes text, or predicts outcomesâ€”all in real time. Integrating AI into MERN apps is the bridge between traditional web development and intelligent experiences.</p>

      <h2>Integration Flow</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Build your ML model in Python using TensorFlow or PyTorch</li>
        <li>Serve the model with a REST API using Flask or FastAPI</li>
        <li>Connect the MERN frontend to this API with fetch or Axios</li>
        <li>Display predictions or visual results in React UI</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Use Cases</h2>
      <p>From product image search to sentiment analysis and face detection, this setup enables features that feel magical to users and powerful to businesses. Be sure to secure and optimize your model APIs for production.</p>
